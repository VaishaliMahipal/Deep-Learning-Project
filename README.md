# Deep-Learning-Project

I have included code for all the deep learning models in the folder. There are three different projects in android studio. 
One is for collecting the data, it is for the smart watch, you need to run it on a smart watch to make it work and you need these three sensors – accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate otherwise app will crash.
 The other project is to detect the blood sugar levels , it is also for the smart watch, you need to run it on a smart watch to make it work and you need these three sensors – accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate otherwise app will crash. It only uses one model in it because of the smart watch cannot handle too much configurations.
There is another project which is for the phone and which have all the codes for every model that is created but it is very big and as phones do not have heart rate sensor, it won’t work. The idea for this it have all the code in it and we can take any particular model from this and replace it in the smart watch app.
 Codes run fine as they are and to run the apps you need to run it on the smart watch with these sensors.
